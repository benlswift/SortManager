# Sort manager

This program generates an array of numbers of a chosen length.
This array is then sorted by a sort algorithm of the user's choosing.

## Requirements
- Create a program that can sort a given array using a bubble sort, merge sort or binary tree
- A factory pattern must be used to create the sorter object

## User Guide

After entering the number of elements a random array is created.
Now you may select a type of sort to run in the array:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Merge Sort
3. Binary Tree

The elements will be sorted and the time elapsed will also be shown.
